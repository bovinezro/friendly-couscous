# friendly-couscous

This is my final project from an online Python course offered through General Assembly. The project is written in Python 3 and features a full graphical interface.

The user should be able to point this application at any functional eGauge meter, provided the meter is accessible remotely and not password protected. The public meter name eGaugeHQ may be used for testing.

The program should generate a very simple PDF report containing the register name, kWh usage (or generation) number, and the requested period. A graph will also be included as part of the PDF.

This project has not been maintained, and there's a lot of room for improvement!
